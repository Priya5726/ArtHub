## Project Proposal

Arthub is an android application designed for all artists and art lovers. Not only
artists will have their art displayed to a wide audience but also there will be
various competition, which could be free or requires a participation fee, and
there will be various incentives for an artist to participate in these competitions.
It’s not only the winners of the competitions who will get benefit from the
competition but also every participant, as their art will be viewed by various
people who might be interested in buying their creation, which brings us to the
next part of the software where anyone can buy any of the art styles displayed.
It will not only provide a platform for the artists but will also help them find
mentors as contact details will be mentioned with every painting (which will not
be visible to all but only for those who request it. and also bridge the gap
between the buyers and sellers of art.

## Technology Used
The Tech Stack of the application is kept simple for easier understanding by large communities
1. Android studio- The main IDE for building the entire project.
2. Firebase and SQLlite- Database used in the project

The entire project is written in java and the frontend is deisgned through android studio using XML.

## How to run
To deploy our application, the user has to follow the belowprovided
steps.
* Download the code provided.
* Open the app folder in android studios.
* In the Android menu, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) >Build APK(s).
* Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done,a pop-up on the bottom right will notify you of its completion.Click the ‘locate’ button in this dialog.
* The ‘locate’ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called “app-debug.apk”.
* Run the “app-debug.apk” file on ur device and the app is ready to be used.

There is a change of a possible error in the Gradle build of the app
src due to the mismatch between the SDK used in the user
machine and the SDK of the host machine. Hence an easier way
to install is using the below link.

This link contains the already installed apk file and hence there
won’t be an issue with the mismatch of SDK.

## Future Scope

In the initial release of our project, we have different art styles, different
competitions paid and unpaid, exhibitions, rewards and offers to attract the
attention of users. Also our present model replicates most of the features
defined earlier. But some of the features of our project can only be
implemented once we have a sufficient knowledge. The feature we are
trying to implement are:


- Let’s say a user want to buy some painting than for that we are
trying to include biding system feature in our application.
- With the newer version we will try to add more art styles, find
ways to improve the connection between the artists around the
globe, more attractive competitions, better rewards etc. we will
also try to add a feature that would recommend paintings to
different users according to their previous purchases and previous
liked paintings.
- We are also planning to add feature by which artists can carry
out live exhibitions
